    "# N-grams, Fastttext, and GloVE\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment focuses on exploring Fasttext and GloVE as NLP methods. We are going to focus on two tasks and ways of understanding models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The traditional, \"model is a classifier\" viewpoint. Here we are going to work with the [AG News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amananandrai/ag-news-classification-dataset) to classify genres\n",
    "2. The more vector-based way, seeing them basically as machines that just generate word vectors, with everything else just being gravy. Barring attaching a specific classifier, GloVE falls entirely under this category.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we are mainly going to be using the [AG News Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amananandrai/ag-news-classification-dataset), a corpus of more than 1 million news articles, each classified as one of four classes: 'Business', 'Sci/Tech', 'World', or 'Sports'. Note, that because of the semi-supervised nature of most methods used in this assignment, we could almost do the whole thing without the labels. They're just there to make it a bit simpler and to provide an obvious usecase.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For the GloVe part, note that you can download all their pretrained vectors at the [GloVe project page](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extra primer on Fasttext\n",
    "\n",
    "As you know, n-grams are pretty useful for improving the otherwise limited bag-of-words (BoW) model. Most often, this is by making distinctions between sentences such as \"good\" and \"not good\" which would be represented somewhat the same in a regular BoW. It is very obvious if we consider the sentence \"Maria stole the milk\" vs \"The milk stole Maria\", two sentences completely identical in the BoW representation, but with two obviously different meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you also know, Fasttext takes this further by creating chracter-wise n-grams. These are made up of n-characters of a single word. This allows fasttext to consider cases such as grammar, where words are spelled similarly and even consider misspellings, if someone makes a mistaek in wirtign a wrod, the character-wise n-gram representation will be **almost** the same as the correct word.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is done by Fasttext simply storing embedding vectors $v_n$ for each n-gram, character or otherwise. Fasttext will simply then average all of these vectors, word, character-wise n-grams, and word-wise n-grams to create the representation for a given text or sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v_{total} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum^N_{n=0} v_n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important note: Fasttext supervised and unsupervised\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look into the technical documentation for the fasttext model, you'll notice that there are options to train both an **unsupervised** and a **supervised** version of the fasttext model. These use similar approaches, but it is arguably the unsupervised model that best describes what the fasttext team wanted to accomplish: efficient word-vector generation for downstream usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "***The supervised model:***\n",
    "- Needs a corpus of text with given labels to train\n",
    "- Does not use skipgram/CBoW, but just works as a 'normal' FFN for classification\n",
    "- Uses character-wise n-grams\n",
    "- Uses word-wise n-grams the same way as the unsupervised model uses character-wise n-grams, treating them as vectors and combining them in the end for the final classification.\n",
    "- Can be directly evaluated by just checking how good it is at predicting the given classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "***The unsupervised model:*** (not important for this assignment or course, just cool to know)\n",
    "- Just needs a corpus of text to train\n",
    "- Does not use wordwise n-grams\n",
    "- Has vectors for each unique character n-gram and each unique word in the corpus (limited by bin size)\n",
    "- Vectors for character n-grams are created indepedently of word vectors, for example the trigram \"her\" present in \"where\" has a different vector representation than the one for the full word \"her\".\n",
    "- Is a purely skipgram/CBoW model (input layer, one hidden, output layer)\n",
    "- Cannot be directly evaluated except in qualitative ways by considering the downstream tasks it will be used in\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Both models***\n",
    "- Only work on CPU (bvadr) (what a time 2015 was!)\n",

    "the usage of the bucket is firstly to hash(convert the word to a constant number) each n-gram.\n",
    "then the algorithm modulates the hash with the bucket variable, which maps the hash to a specifik bucket index. whithout buckethashing, the vocabulary size would be ridiciously large, given that it is dependent on innumerable words, and their many n-grams. by using the buckethashing method we can work with a vocab of a given size, because we control the indexing, which means we have a fixed M-dimensional embedding matrix.\n",
    "there is the risk of two different n-grams having a hash that modulated with the bucket gives the same index. this is alright tho, because the dimensionality of the bucket is rather high, so the risk of \"collision\" is low.

    "For a given word that exceeds the vocabulary, its still possible to represent it as a sum of the embeddings of its mixed n-grams, if those are present(most likely) in other words. so there is a small risk of this causing issues, but by smartly grabbing known words, we can still represent the unknown word out of vocab\n",
    "\n",

    ",then we would hash each n-gram to their respective buckets, and from our bucket index we find the pretrained embedding vectors, which we then combine to a new vector. because the model uses meaningful representations of the n-grams, our new vector is most likely a sensible guess to it's \"true\" value. \n",
    "\n",
    "</span>\n",
    "\n",

By these propabilities we can calculate estimates of words occuring in a sequence, given their prior word. prior propablities are closely related to our understanding of n-grams. for instance we can use a naive bayes classifier model for sentiment analysis, given a class c(positive/negative). \n",

Given the word2vec algorithm we embed the words and make them vectors(static). here we get issues when refering to something, since in case of boty Mary and James want *it*, which we can infer to be the puppy and the window, but our machine has no clues, since it uses the same vector. \n",

    "GloVe is called a \"global log-bilinear regression model\" which combines the strengths of global matrix factorization and local context window methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In plain English, this means it combines methods that work by collecting information on the entire corpus, with other methods that capture more local patterns, essentially what we see with Fasttext that considers local n-grams. GloVe just considers \"context windows\" rather than an n-gram. Overall, what they want are nicely defined, linear relationships, decided by comparing the co-occurences of different words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The selling point really, is that while a run-of-the-mill neural network **may** be able to answer the questions: \"Skibidi is to Toilet as Fanum is to ...?\", it will not necessarily be able to do it in a linear manner. Therefore considering all the word vectors together in their latent space, may not yield good information. GloVe fixes this by keeping all vector substructures linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, GloVe trains by mixing a [Skipgram model](http://mccormickml.com/2016/04/19/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model/) (just a neural network) with a function that works more on the entire corpus, while maintaining a weighting between the two. Because GloVe works best on huge corpora of data, we are not going to train it ourselves, but just use pretrained GloVe vectors, collected from their [project page](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **4.1. On their project page, GloVe gives a few different possibilities for GloVe vectors, including ones with embedding dimension 50, 100, 200, and 300. What potential downsides and upsides are there to larger/smaller embedding dimensions? Consider both training and subsequent usage.**\n",

    "\n",
    "Higher dimension embeddings occasionally overestimate the semantic similarity between antonyms(antiwords). in general:\n",
    "higher dimension; more representational power, but risk of overfitting  and higher cost. smaller dimensions: faster, cheaper and decent for small tasks, risk of underfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4.2. Also on their webage, they give two options for the \"Common Crawl\" GloVe vector set: \"42B tokens, 1.9M vocab, 300d vectors\" and \"840B tokens, 2.2M vocab, 300d vectors\". What are the differences between these?**\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"background-color: #00590D; padding:8px; display:block; border-left:4px solid #4682b4\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Crawl is a large dataset gathered from the internet. The difference between the two sets is mostly the data size (token amount). An important detail to note is however that the text was not lowercased for the larger vocabulary, making the results not directly comparable. \n",
    "\n",
    "</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4.3. GloVE is presented purely as an embedding model, without any sort of infrastructure to support classification, generation, or anything of the sort. Why is such an only-embedding model still valuable??**\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"background-color: #00590D; padding:8px; display:block; border-left:4px solid #4682b4\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it's an effectient method of vectorizing the corpus, and ís a great base for creating classification models and all that. \n",
    "\n",
    "</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4.4. In the GloVe paper, they say they attempt to model $F(w_i, w_j, \\tilde{w_k}) = \\frac{P_{ik}}{P_jk}$. That is, the probability of one word given another, compared to the probability of that same word given a third word. For this, they briefly consider using a neural network as the function $F$ but decide against it, as \"doing so would obfuscate the linear strcutures we are trying to capture\", what linear structures are talked about and how would they be obfuscated by using something like a neural network?**\n",

    "<span style=\"background-color: #00590D; padding:8px; display:block; border-left:4px solid #4682b4\">\n",

    "a NN would \"obfuscate\" the data, because it uses non-linear transformations, and that would make the semantic relationsships non-linear and complicated. Non-linearity would maje it hard to directly interpret the learned vector differences as meaningful direction, we would lose the simple linear structure, that allows us to use vector maths to express relations\n",
